# Actions SDK

## What are Actions?
Actions are specification-compliant APIs that return transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to be previewed, signed, and sent across various contexts, including buttons, widgets, and websites across the internet. They allow developers to integrate web3 functionalities seamlessly into their environments, enabling blockchain transactions without navigating away to a different app or webpage.

## Coming Soon...

Actions SDK will provide:

- A standardized JSON schema for defining actions
- SDK functionality for creating and managing actions
- Support for decentralized storage via IPFS
